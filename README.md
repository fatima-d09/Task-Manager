# Task-Manager
Task Manager I created for my self.

This is a simple web-based Task Manager application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask). It allows users to manage their tasks, set goals, and keep track of miscellaneous things.

# Features

- <strong>Goals:</strong> Add and view personal goals.
- <strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Add and view miscellaneous things for quick notes or reminders.
